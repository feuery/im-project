#IM-project

This will become a clojurefied instant messaging thing. 

This was a school project previously. Due to old code being utter shit (look at commits c60a8869bc26d338f871a2d3d754e0ecd3b141c9 and previous), I've decided to fix this project. Backend will be not-as-stupid clojure and frontend will initially serve as a project to learn ClojureScript with.
